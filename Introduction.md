Hello, World!
I am a 31 year old who works in creative industry as a copywriter and social media strategist. I have been feeling a little burnout from my daily worklives so I am learning programming, primarily Python to be able to pivot into the field of data analysis or data engineering.
I don't know why I made my repo public, maybe I just want to make it seems like I'm logging my progress for the world to see.
Wish me luck and good day to you all!
